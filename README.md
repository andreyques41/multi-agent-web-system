## Overview

This project demonstrates practical AI-assisted engineering:
- Multi-agent coordination for development tasks
- Structured prompts for consistent outputs
- Quality control and human-in-the-loop validation
- 6 specialized agents (PM, BA, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, QA, DevOps)

## Architecture

```
Project Manager Agent
    ├── Business Analyst Agent
    ├── Backend Developer Agent
    ├── Frontend Developer Agent
    ├── QA Engineer Agent
    └── DevOps Engineer Agent
```

Each agent has:
- Specialized role and expertise
- Defined tools and capabilities
- Context from previous agents
- Output validation

---

## Use Cases

- Automated code scaffolding
- Documentation generation
- Code review assistance
- Technical analysis workflows
- Workflow automation

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Agent orchestration with CrewAI
- Strategic AI application in software development
- Prompt engineering for consistent outputs
- LLM integration and model selection
- Production-ready AI workflows (not toy examples)
